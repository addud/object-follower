How to calibrate the Color Sensor


1. How to calibrate white balance
Puts the sensor into white balance calibration mode. For best results
the sensor should be pointed at a diffuse white surface at a distance
of approximately 15mm before calling this method. After a fraction of
a second the sensor lights will flash and the calibration is done. When
calibrated, the sensor keeps this information in non-volatile memory.

2. How to calibrate black/ambient level
Puts the sensor into black/ambient level calibration mode. For best
results the sensor should be pointed in a direction with no obstacles
for 50cm or so. This reading the sensor will use as a base level for
other readings. After a fraction of a second the sensor lights will
flash and the calibration is done. When calibrated, the sensor keeps
this information in non-volatile memory.
