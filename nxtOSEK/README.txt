================================================================================

What's new in 2.17 (February 2012)
=============================
- Added ecrobot_exec_NXT_BIOS C/C++ API to be able to execute NXT BIOS from application automatically
(See samples_c\executeNXTBIOS, samples_c++\cpp\ExecNXTBIOS samples)
Note that the new C/C++ API works only when NXT BIOS is used. Otherwise it does nothing
Note that the new C/C++ API requires NXT BIOS 1.04 or later
- Updated NXT BIOS to 1.04
  - Uploaded application is executed after program upload without turn off/on the NXT
  - Improved robustness of program upload (I hope)
  - Program upload progress bar is replaced with simple "Uploading..." message to reduce IRQ load for LCD updates
Note that the new C/C++ API and the update of NXT BIOS improve usability of NXT BIOS and user can design prefered application upload sequence

What's new in 2.161 (December 2011)
=============================
- Updated ecrobot C++ API reference generated by doxygen
- Updated ecrobot_base.c to support ARM EABI
Special thanks to Dmitry Prokhorov

What's new in 2.16 (December 2011)
=============================

- Modified LFLAG in tool_gcc.mak to link ANSI-C math library properly
Special thanks to Paul Besson to report the bug

- Added NO_RUN_ENTER_STOP_EXIT compile switch macro to enable to suppress initial splash screen and disable RUN/ENTER/STOP/EXIT operations assignment to the NXT buttons
(See samples_c\noRunEnterStopExit, samples_c\noRunEnterStopExitAndBluetooth and samples_c++\cpp\Nxt2 samples)
- Added ecrobot_restart_NXT and ecrobot_shutdown_NXT C API to be able to re-start/shutdown NXT
- Added ecrobot_get_button_state C API and BTN_ORANGE_RECT/BTN_LEFT/BTN_RIGHT/BTN_GRAY_RECT macros to be able to retrieve status of the buttons on the NXT
- Added the above new C API equivalent properties to ecrobot::Nxt C++ class
Note that the above new features allows users to design user orignal interface with the NXT LCD and buttons instead of nxtOSEK default
initial display and RUN/ENTER/STOP/EXIT buttons assignment. It also reduces ROM size about 2 Kbytes.

What's new in 2.15 (March 2011)
=============================
- Improved and fixed bugs in Bluetooth C/C++ API
1. Removed BT_BUF_SIZE macro in C API and MAX_BT_DATA_LENGTH in C++ API
2. Corrected maximum size of Rx data packet buffer to be 126 (formerely, 254 bytes) for ecrobot_read_bt_packet and related C++ API 
3. Fixed bugs in ecrobot_get_device_address, ecrobot_get_device_name and related C++ API
4. [RECOMMENDED TO USE] Added C/C++ API to send/read data without data frame restrictions
Note thath the new C/C++ send/read API are faster and it allows user to fully design data frame structure (extra 2 bytes can be used in 
user application)
5. Added C/C++ API to get signal strength (RSSI)
6. Added Bluetooth C/C++ samples 
 (samples_c\btinfo, samples_c\btecho, samples_c++\cpp\BluetoothInformation, samples_c++\cpp\BluetoothEcho)

Special thanks to Marcel Hein and Benjamin Bode who developed the APIs
- Added HiTechnic Prototype Sensor C API (See nxtOSEK\samples_c\hitechtest3)
- Improved robustness of NXT BIOS and appflash.exe (upload sequence, check sum and error routines)
Note: If program uproad process was stopped due to some reason (e.g. USB disconnection, data corruption)
      Keep pushing EXIT button on the NXT longer than one second to shut down the NXT.
- Fixed a bug in ECRobot C++ API(GyroSensor.setOffset)
- Fixed a bug for ecrobot_device_initialize when application program is re-started

Special thanks to Thanh Pham who develop the API

What's new in 2.12 (March 2010)
=============================
- sg.exe is removed from nxtOSEK (March 01, 2010)
To keep the terms of Sourceforge.net, I have decided to remove sg.exe (an OSEK OIL parser and code generator) from 
nxtOSEK. sg.exe which was included in nxtOSEK is same as sg.exe in TOPPERS/OSEK 1.1 at TOPPERS project where outside of Sourceforge.net. TOPPERS/OSEK 1.1 is available here: http://www.toppers.jp/download.cgi/osek_os-1.1.lzh
osek_os-1.1.lzh is compressed as LZH format and it needs to use a lzh supported file extractor, for example, 7-zip
(http://www.7-zip.org/) which would work in Windows XP/Vista and Linux.
To use sg.exe in osek_os-1.1.lzh for nxtOSEK:
 - Extract osek-os-1.1.lzh
 - Copy extracted /toppers_osek/sg/sg.exe to nxtOSEK/toppers_osek/sg directory 

- Corrected inconsistent linefeeds (Unix + DOS) in the source files
  + Special thanks to Bernhard Merkle

  + Special thanks to Rade to test it patiently
- Added mindsensor NxtCam C API developed by Loic Royer
  + Check his cool nxtjohnny5 project: http://code.google.com/p/nxtjohnny5/
- Added mindsensor NxtCam C++ API (see samples_c++\cpp\Camera)
  + Based on Loic's C API (but, never tested because I don't have a NXTCam)
- Added BTConnection C++ API. This is a helper class for Bluetooth connection.
  (see samples_c++\cpp\BTConnection)
- Added clearRow member function to Lcd C++ API.
- Refactored and added dynamic gyro sensor offset calibration feature to nxtway_gs++ sample
  (see samples_c++\cpp\NXTway_GS++)
- Added NXTway-GS++ based Line Tracing robot (see samples_c++\cpp\NXTway_LT)
- Added Tribot R/C sample (see samples_c++\cpp\TribotRC\)

What's new in 2.10 (May 2009)
=============================
- Improve ARM7-AVR communication to be more robust (especially effective for TOPPERS/JSP)
  + Updated lejos device drivers (the low level stuff has become most stable ever!)
  + Note that this change also makes NXT BIOS update to v1.02
- Refactored ECRobot C++ API
  + Added global C++ new/delete overload to reduce memory consumption (ecrobot\c++\util\New.cpp)
    * Overloaded new/delete does not have exception handlings and is not thread safe
    * Improved linker script for heap memory (ecrobot\c\sam7_ecrobot.lds)
  + Changed behavior of Motor.reset() C++ API
    * Stop the motor immediately (with brake) even if Motor.setBrake(false) was set
  + Unified data type of string parameters to (const) CHAR* in Bluetooth C/C++ API
  + Removed unneccessary explicit destructors to reduce memory consumption
  + Added explicit keyword to converting constructors to prevent implicitly converted

NXT is automatically turned off to avoid battery discharge. 
- Fixed a bug in ECRobot USB API (ecrobot\nxtusb.c)
- Fixed a bug in Makefile for C++ library (c++\src\Makefile)

What's new in 2.06 (January 2009)
=============================
- Fixed bugs in nxtcommfantom API (ecrobot\nxtcommfantom)
Note that multiple NXTs connection seem to not work, so the API is restricted for only a NXT. 

What's new in 2.05 (January 2009)
=============================
- Officially supported for Windows Vista (Enhanced NXT firmware and NXT BIOS) 
- Updated ECRobot USB C API to be able to communicate with LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Driver (samples\usbtest, usbhost)

Special thanks to Yu Yang san.

What's new in 2.01 (May 2008)
=============================
- Changed the project name from LEJOS OSEK to nxtOSEK. 
This change is not due to legal issue. However, LEJOS(leJOS) sometimes seems to make
people misunderstand LEJOS OSEK as "an alternative Java VM" or "an add-on of leJOS NXJ".
Therefore, we have changed the name, but, it would not affect the backward compatibility
of APIs and existing users applications.
- Support for BMP file format for LCD graphics (see samples/bmptest, anime)
- Support for WAV file format for sound generation. (see samples/wavtest)
- Added USB API (see samples/usbtest)
- Added I2C API
- Support Bluetooth run-time connection (see samples/btmaster, btslave)
- User customizable BMP file based splash screen
- No functionality changes in NXT BIOS (you don't need to update NXT BIOS)

What's new in 2.00 (April 2008)
===============================
Until LEJOS OSEK 1.10, LEJOS OSEK program had to be uploaded into SRAM of AT91SAM7S256 
in the NXT due to Flash endurance. This used to be a big restriction of LEJOS OSEK 
compared to other NXT firmwares and programming environments. But now...
The new LEJOS OSEK provides: 
 - Execution of LEJOS OSEK application in Flash/SRAM.
 - NXT BIOS supports LEJOS OSEK application flash WITHOUT touching the lock bits of AT91SAM7S.
 - 224Kbytes Flash and appx. 50Kbytes SRAM for user application and LEJOS OSEK in Flash.
 - New splash screen and main screen with status bar.
 - Speed up compilation time by archiving LEJOS OSEK application independent part.


Installation and Set up
=======================
Installation and set up for nxtOSEK is here:
http://lejos-osek.sourceforge.net/installation.htm


How to upload a program to the NXT
==================================
nxtOSEK application program can be uploaded either Flash or SRAM.
In case of uploading a program into Flash, it needs to upload NXT BIOS
and nxtOSEK application.
http://lejos-osek.sourceforge.net/howtoupload.htm

and, there are many samples and application videos at nxtOSEK Website.

Enjoy it!
